What is a Generic
A generic is a feature that lets classes and methods to function without specifying data types. you can create classes, methods, and interfaces that would
take the type parameter and let you reuse code for different data types without having to retype any of them if it should take in different data types


In which situation/set-up is recursion best avoided?
When the problem would lead to infinite recursive calls that causes a stack overflow. its also not optimal if an iterative approact is simpler and fastere


When would we prefer throwable over try/catch?
Since throwable is the superclass of all exceptions, it can be useful for logging every possible failures and dealing with critical errors
